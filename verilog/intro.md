INTRODUCTION
============

- Hardware description language (HDL)
- Language used to describe a digital system
- It allows us to design a digital design at _behaviour level, register transfer level (RTL), gate level and at switch level_
- Behavioural level:
  - Describes a system by concurrent algorithms (behavioural)
  - Each algorithm is sequential
  - _Functions, tasks and always blocks_ are the main elements
  - No regard to the structural realisation of the design
- Register-Transfer level
  - Specify the characteristics of a circuit by operations and the transfer of data between registers
  - An explicit clock is used
  - Contains exact timing bounds i.e. operations are scheduled to occur at certain times
- Gate level
  - Logic level
  - Characteristics of a system are described by logical links and their timing properties
  - All signals are discrete signals
  - Usable operation - predefined logic primitives i.e. AND, OR, NOT etc gates.
  - Generated by tools like synthesis tools and this netlist is used for gate level simulation and for backend

Verilog in One Day
==================

Specifications
--------------
- Restrictions and requirements placed on the design
- _What is being built?_
- E.g. a two agent arbiter
  - A device that selects among two agents competing for mastership
  - Specification:
    - Two agent arbiter
    - Active high asynchronous reset
    - Fixed priority, with agent 0 having priority over agent 1
    - Grant will be asserted as long as request is asserted
  - Block diagram - abstraction of the data flow through a diagram (see notebook)

Code Of Module
--------------
- Declare module name and port names
- Define the direction of each port
- NB Bi-directional ports exists too (inout)
  - e.g. inout read_enable;
- NB Vector signals i.e. signals composed of sequences of more than one bit
  - e.g. inout[7:0] address
  - [7:0] means:
    - little-endian convention
    - start with 0 at the rightmost bit to begin the vector, then move to the left

Data Type
---------
- Driver
  - is a data type which can drive a load
  - (in a physical circuit), would be anything that electrons can move through/into
    - can store a value e.g. flip-flop (_reg_)
    - can not store value, but connects two points e.g. wire (_wire_)

Control Statements
------------------
- if, else, repeat, while, for, case

### If-Else
- check a condition to decide whether or not to execute a portion of code
