# INTRODUCTION

- Hardware description language (HDL)
- Language used to describe a digital system
- It allows us to design a digital design at _behaviour level, register transfer level (RTL), gate level and at switch level_
- Behavioural level:
-- Describes a system by concurrent algorithms (behavioural)
-- Each algorithm is sequential
-- _Functions, tasks and always blocks_ are the main elements
-- No regard to the structural realisation of the design
- Register-Transfer level
-- Specify the characteristics of a circuit by operations and the transfer of data between registers
-- An explicit clock is used
-- Contains exact timing bounds i.e. operations are scheduled to occur at certain times
- Gate level
-- Logic level
-- Characteristics of a system are described by logical links and their timing properties
-- All signals are discrete signals
-- Usable operation - predefined logic primitives i.e. AND, OR, NOT etc gates.
-- Generated by tools like synthesis tools and this netlist is used for gate level simulation and for backend
